# Gym Management System

## Overview
This Java and JavaFX application serves as a Gym Management System, allowing managers to perform various actions such as adding/deleting members, viewing member information, and utilizing a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced interaction.

## Assessment Context
This project was developed as part of the Programming Principles II module in my first year of university studies, focusing on object-oriented programming.

## Project Structure
### 1. UML Diagrams
- Class Diagram: Describes the relationships between classes, including DefaultMember, StudentMember, Over60Member, Date, MyGymManager, and the GymManager interface.
- Use Cases: Illustrates two or more use cases for the system.

### 2. Functionalities
- **Membership Management Console:**
  - Add new members (Default, Student, Over60) with relevant information.
  - Delete members by membership number and display available spaces.
  - Print the list of members, sorted in ascending order by name.
  - Save member information to a file.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
  - Visualize a table with member information.
  - Search members based on parameters.

### 3. Implementation Details
- **Object-Oriented Principles:**
  - Inheritance: Utilizes DefaultMember superclass and subclasses (StudentMember, Over60Member).
  - Encapsulation: Ensures appropriate encapsulation and information hiding.

- **Testing and Validation:**
  - Design a comprehensive test plan with specific instructions and conditions.
  - Implement automated testing using JUnit or other tools for each console menu use case.
  - Error handling and input validation contribute to code robustness.

### 4. Video Demonstration
- A [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/jVRj1gps3bA) is available, providing a detailed demonstration and explanation of the system and code.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `Main.java` file to launch the Gym Management System.

## Usage
- Follow the console menu for membership management actions.
- Explore the GUI for enhanced member visualization and search capabilities.
